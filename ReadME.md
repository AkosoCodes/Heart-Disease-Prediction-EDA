<h1 align="center">Heart Disease Prediction EDA</h1>

<p>This is a project for the Artificial Intelligence course, where we explore the Heart Failure dataset from Kaggle and use it to predict the presence of heart disease based on various attributes related to heart health.</p>

## üßê | Project Task <a name="project_task"></a>

**TASK: Do exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the selected dataset, to develop an understanding of it.**

Some of the requirements include:
- Use a Classification model.
- Present the performance of the model.
- Change parameters in order to improve results.
- Express data using different techniques and plots.
    
## ‚ÑπÔ∏è | Context & Dataset <a name="data"></a>
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death globally, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths per year. 
Heart failure, a common event caused by CVDs, can be predicted using the Heart Failure dataset, which contains 11 attributes related to heart health such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and exercise-induced angina. 

This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and is widely used in machine learning research to develop predictive models for early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases.
